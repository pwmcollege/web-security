## The End of our Journey 🌊

This is where you prove everything you've learned actually stuck. Every challenge in this module comes without hints, walkthroughs, or hand-holding.

Challenges are ranked by ocean depth - the deeper you go, the harder it gets. From the Sunlight Zone, where beginners might still have a chance, down to the Trenches, where only the most skilled survive. Can you handle the *pressure*?

Each depth level brings new vulnerabilities and more complex exploitation chains. Some might look familiar from earlier modules, but the deeper you dive, the more unforgiving it becomes.

Complete this module to earn your badge. No pain no gain.
