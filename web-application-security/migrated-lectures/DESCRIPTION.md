Our beloved professor has finally made the leap from his chaotic [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pwncollege) streaming days to a more professional [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@pwncollege) lecture series! Back on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pwncollege), his streams were legendary for their... let's call them 'technical quirks' - lag, crashes, bizarre timer glitches, you name it.

But now he's promised a much more polished educational experience on his new platform. Just watch his inaugural hype lecture to completion and earn your scholarly achievement! Surely he's worked out all those pesky technical issues by now, right?
