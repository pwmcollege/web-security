Welcome to The Art of Web dojo. This dojo aims to teache you about web vulnerabilities.

We created this dojo to fill the web content void that pwn.college doesn't offer. We aim to make something that might eventually become the official pwn.college web belt.

Each module starts simple but gets harder fast, and they have a generous amount of hints. Want the badge? You'll need to prove yourself worthy, and beat the [Web Application Security](https://pwn.college/the-art-of-web~f98637a0/web-application-security/) module. No hints, no mercy.

This dojo is for anyone interested in web security, from complete beginners to web masters looking for entertainment.

This dojo is open source! Pull requests are appreciated. [Github](https://github.com/snowy-fluff/the-art-of-web).
