## The Art of Web 🕸️

Welcome to The Art of Web dojo.

### What

This dojo teaches you about web vulnerabilities, the kind that show up in CTFs and real pentests.

### Why

We created this dojo to fill the web content void that pwn.college doesn't offer. Under the guidance from [Zardus](https://search.asu.edu/profile/3153940), we aim to make something that might eventually become the official pwn.college web belt.

### How

Each module starts simple but gets harder fast, and they have a generous amount of hints.\
Want the badge? You'll need to prove yourself worthy, and beat the `Web Application Security` module. No hints, no mercy.

### Who

This dojo is for anyone interested in web security, from complete beginners to web gods looking for some entertainment.

### Where

This dojo is open source! Pull requests are appreciated. [Github](https://github.com/snowy-fluff/the-art-of-web).
